# Environment Variable and Set-UID Program Lab

## Task 1: Manipulating Environment Variables

In the first task, several commands such as env, printenv, export and unset, among others, were used in order to have a better understanding of the functioning and manipulation of environment variables.

* Firstly, by using the printenv command we were able to print out the environment variables, as seen below.

* Secondly, we used export and unset in order to manipulate the environment variables. When using export without any further arguments, it is returned a list of the environment variables (similarly to printenv), as shown in the first screenshot. Here, we can see that HOME has a default value of (?). Then, when inserting a variable name as argument (HOME), as shown in the X screenshot, as well as its new value ([NEW VALUE (.../cenas)]), we were able to set this new value to the HOME variable.
